The main folder for the project is the folder named "money_weist_demo". The files in the folder are subject to changes which will be used for the actual app. The programming techniques used to make the demo app dont make it robust enough and hence the idea of making a better one.

The other folders besides the money_weist_demo are some tutorials to guide you as to how the demo was built.



THANK YOU AND FUCK YOU :D
