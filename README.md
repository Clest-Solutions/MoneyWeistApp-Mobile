#Steps to writing your script and integrating it in Github

The first step is to have git installed on your computer. Once you have git installed, click on and fork the repository here After forking the repository, clone the repository to your local computer. You can do this by typing in your console git clone [link-to-your-forked-version-of-the-repo] Next up you navigate into the scripts folder in the cloned repository Confirm you are in the develop branch by typing git checkout develop Create a new file this directory. Save the file and commit your changes. Push your changes back to your fork in Github by doing a git push. On Github, create a new pull request to the develop branch in the base repository. Once this is done, the PR would be merged.

PLEASE BE SURE NOT TO MODIFY ANY OTHER FILES OTHER THAN YOUR SCRIPT FILE AS THIS COULD DELAY THE MERGE OF YOUR PR.
